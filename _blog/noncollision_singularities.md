In mathematics, the $n$-body problem is the problem of predicting the individual motions of a group of particles under the influence of Newtonian grivity.
In the classic incarnation of the problem, the particles are point masses (usually all the same mass for simplicity) and the only force acting on them is gravity.
In Newtonian gravity, the gravitational force between two bodies scales as the inverse square of the distance between the two bodies ($F_g \propto 1/r^2$).
Thus, in the $n$-body problem, it is possible to have singularities where the distance between two bodies goes to zero ($r \to 0$) and the force between them goes to infinity ($F_g \to \infty$).
These are called collision singularities.

It was conjectured by Poincar√© that the $n$-body problem can have noncollision singularities when $n \geq 4$ (that is when there are at least 4 bodies in the system).
This conjecture was (partially) proven in 1988 by Jeff Xia [<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2946572?origin=crossref)">Xia, 1992</a>].
Xia found a scinario with $n=5$ where the bodies do not collide but one of the bodies goes to infinity in finite time.
Later Xue found a case for $n=4$ [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0048">Xue, 2014</a>].

I would like to explore the implications of these noncollision singularities in the context of particle physics.
If possible, one can imagine particle accelerators which can exploit these singularities to outperform current particle accelerator technology.
Another potential application would be to use this effect as a probe for small distance forces.

However, adapting the classic mathematical $n$-body problem to the context of particle physics is not trivial.
The particles in the $n$-body problem are point masses with only one force acting on them which scales as $1/r^2$.
In particle physics, the particles have mass, charge, and other properties and interact via the four fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force).
Thus, the $n$-body problem in particle physics is much more complicated than the classic mathematical $n$-body problem.
We need also mention that at small distances, quantum mechanics becomes dominant and the classical $n$-body problem is no longer valid.
