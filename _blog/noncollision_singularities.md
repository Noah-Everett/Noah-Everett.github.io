In mathematics, the $n$-body problem is the problem of predicting the individual motions of a group of particles under the influence of Newtonian grivity.
In the classic incarnation of the problem, the particles are point masses (usually all the same mass for simplicity) and the only force acting on them is gravity.
In Newtonian gravity, the gravitational force between two bodies scales as the inverse square of the distance between the two bodies ($F_g \propto 1/r^2$).
Thus, in the $n$-body problem, it is possible to have singularities where the distance between two bodies goes to zero ($r \to 0$) and the force between them goes to infinity ($F_g \to \infty$).
These are called collision singularities.

It was conjectured by Poincaré that the $n$-body problem can have noncollision singularities when $n \geq 4$ (that is when there are at least 4 bodies in the system).
This conjecture was (partially) proven in 1988 by Jeff Xia [<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2946572?origin=crossref)">Xia, 1992</a>].
Xia found a scinario with $n=5$ where the bodies do not collide but one of the bodies goes to infinity in finite time.
Later Xue found a case for $n=4$ [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0048">Xue, 2014</a>].

I would like to explore the implications of these noncollision singularities in the context of particle physics.
If possible, one can imagine particle accelerators which can exploit these singularities to outperform current particle accelerator technology.
Another potential application would be to use this effect as a probe for small distance forces.

However, adapting the classic mathematical $n$-body problem to the context of particle physics is not trivial.
The particles in the $n$-body problem are point masses with only one force acting on them which scales as $1/r^2$.
In particle physics, the particles have mass, charge, and other properties and interact via the four fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force).
Thus, the $n$-body problem in particle physics is much more complicated than the classic mathematical $n$-body problem.
We need also mention that at small distances, quantum mechanics becomes dominant and the classical $n$-body problem is no longer valid.

The $N$-Body problem in mathematics addresses the challenge of predicting the motions of several particles under mutual gravitational interaction. In its classical form, it involves point masses influenced only by Newtonian gravity, where the force between two bodies follows an inverse square law, ￼. This leads to collision singularities, where bodies can theoretically reach a point where their distance becomes zero, resulting in an infinite force.

A more fascinating aspect of the $N$-Body problem arises in systems where ￼. Poincaré suggested the possibility of noncollision singularities—situations where, although the bodies do not physically collide, one or more of them can exhibit extreme behavior, such as moving off to infinity in finite time. This was partially confirmed by Jeff Xia in 1988, who demonstrated a scenario where five bodies exhibit such behavior. Subsequent work by Xue extended this finding to a four-body case.

Implications for Particle Physics

The potential crossover of these noncollision singularities into particle physics presents exciting theoretical possibilities. Particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), currently rely on accelerating particles to high velocities and causing them to collide, facilitating the discovery of fundamental particles. If noncollision singularities could be leveraged, they might lead to the development of accelerators that can surpass existing technologies. The key idea would be the ability to manipulate particle trajectories to extreme distances (or velocities) without physical collisions, perhaps uncovering novel phenomena.

Additionally, these singularities might serve as tools to probe small-scale forces. In particle physics, forces operate at vastly different ranges and strengths—gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force all play roles. At extremely small distances, quantum mechanical effects become significant, and classical descriptions like the gravitational ￼-Body problem are no longer valid. However, noncollision singularities might provide a way to indirectly study interactions at small scales, offering insights into force behaviors that might not be easily accessible otherwise.

Challenges

However, applying the classical $N$-Body framework to particle physics introduces several challenges. Unlike the point masses in the classic problem, particles in the quantum world have multiple properties, such as mass and charge, and interact via more than just gravity. The inclusion of electromagnetism, the weak and strong nuclear forces, and the influence of quantum mechanics makes this far more complex. Additionally, classical mechanics breaks down at quantum scales, meaning any model must eventually reconcile with quantum field theory.

Thus, while noncollision singularities offer intriguing possibilities, much theoretical development is required before such concepts can be directly applied to particle physics. The exploration of these singularities might push the boundaries of both mathematics and fundamental physics, contributing to our understanding of the universe at the smallest scales.
