<h1>Using LLMs to Find Solutions to Unsolved Anomalies</h1>
<p style="margin: 0;">Originally written: Oct 29, 2024 by Noah Everett as part of the Ideas Blog</p>

## Introduction

Unsolved anomalies in science and mathematics have long been a source of fascination and frustration for researchers. 
These anomalies represent gaps in our understanding of the natural world, often defying explanation despite numerous attempts. 
Traditional methods of solving these anomalies involve human intuition, creativity, and rigorous mathematical reasoning.
However, the rise of large language models (LLMs) in artificial intelligence presents a new opportunity to tackle these challenges.

I propose that there may already exist solutions to unsolved anomalies which have not been linked to the anomalies themselves. 
These solutions may be buried in the vast amounts of text and data available on the internet, scientific literature, and other sources. 
By leveraging LLMs we can search for and extract these hidden solutions, potentially shedding light on long-standing mysteries.

## Overview of the Approach

The approach involves training an LLM on a diverse corpus of text data, including scientific papers, books, websites, and other sources.
I hope that pre-existing models/architectures like those from OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic (among many others)
