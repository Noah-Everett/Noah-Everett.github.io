# Radon Mitiagtion For Rare Event Searches
<details markdown="1"><summary><b>Projects</b></summary>
Radon is the largest source of backgrounds for many particle physics experiments like LUX-ZEPLIN, XENONnT, and nEXO because of the broad range of particles and energies its daughter’s decays produce. 
To minimize the backgrounds from radon, it is necessary to select materials that produce the least amount of this radioactive noble gas. 

### Radon Assay for nEXO

**Abstract:**
The radon assay system at SLAC employs an electrostatic chamber (ESC) which is biased to drift charged ions to a silicon diode where subsequent alpha decays in the chain are measured and identified by their energy. 
Analysis software is used to convert the measured alpha decay rates and energies to initial populations of atoms supporting the emanation of radon.
The focus of my work was to develop a Monte Carlo simulation of the radon assay system to check new fitting routines, and to also develop a new fitting method to determine the initial populations of atoms supporting the radon emanation. 
This new fitting method makes use of the full history of the assay run, which significantly reduces the required assay time, allowing SLAC to assay nEXO’s components faster leading to a reduction in nEXO’s development and assembly time.

# Accelerator Neutrino Neutron Interaction Experiment (ANNIE)
ANNIE is a 26-ton gadolinium-doped water Cherenkov detector on the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab. 
The primary physics goal of ANNIE is to make precision measurements of the number of final state neutrons from neutrino interactions in water to improve the systematic uncertainties of next-generation long-baseline neutrino experiments. 
In addition, ANNIE is also doing detector R\&D on new Large Area Picosecond PhotoDetectors (LAPPDs) and Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) detector medium.
The ANNIE collaboration consists of more than 40 collaborators from 19 institutions and 2 national labs in 5 countries.

In addition, ANNIE is also doing detector R&D on new Large Area Picosecond PhotoDetectors (LAPPDs) and Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) detector medium. 
To achieve ANNIE’s ambitious physics goals, while fully accommodating its unique R&D campaign, a new likelihood-based reconstruction method is being developed. 
This reconstruction method will also allow for detailed studies of the current ANNIE detector, along with future detector configurations. 
In addition, the methodology used to develop this reconstruction method can be generically applied to other optical experiments for reconstruction and detector studies.

### Feasibility Study For Neutrino-Argon Interaction Measurement in ANNIE
<img src="/images/Ev-nfn_v06.pdf" style="max-height: 250px; max-width: 900px; margin-right: 16px; margin-bottom: 10px" align=left>
**Abstract:**
The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) aims to measure the neutrino CP-violating phase and determine the mass ordering, using the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) technology. 
These measurements rely on the precise reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. 
However, the nuclear effects on neutrino-nucleus interactions are not well understood in argon, which could affect the precision of the experiment. 
Of particular interest, the measurement of the number of final-state neutrons from neutrino interactions can help constrain the theoretical neutrino-nucleus interaction models. 
To study neutrino-argon interactions, we propose to use the currently existing Accelerator Neutrino Neutron Interaction Experiment (ANNIE) at the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab. 
ANNIE is a water-based neutrino detector but can be modified to study neutrino-argon interactions such as those in DUNE. 
A feasible experimental strategy is to deploy a liquid argon target at ANNIE's fiducial volume location.

### Using Direction Sensitive Photosenors for Detailed Topological Reconstruction in Unsegmented Scintillation Detectors Without Drift Field
<img src="/images/Screenshot 2023-08-06 at 11.01.07 PM.png" style="max-height: 250px; max-width: 900px; margin-right: 16px; margin-bottom: 10px" align=left>
**Abstract:**
We propose a novel method for fine grained ($\sim1$ cm) topological reconstruction in homogeneous, unsegmented scintillation detectors without the use of large electric fields used to drift charged particles such as those in NEXT, MicroBooNE, DUNE, etc.
This is made possible using a combination of traditional photosensors combined with a lens system which converts the direction of the incident photon into a physical position able to be measured by a photosensor.
We call this system a Direction Sensitive PhotoDetector (DSPD).
To increase the angular sensitivity of each DSPD, we limit their field of view using a callorimetetric materail, thus allowing for complete energy reconstruction.
We present a proof of concept for this detector by simulating a XLZD-sized detector ($\sim40$ tonnes) with Geant4.

### Search for Visible Dark Photon Decay in SciBooNE and ANNIE [Preprint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rfW47OuC8Mk8fj-Vm9g3RvSR7N3_EiAV/view?usp=sharing){: .btn .btn--info .btn--small}{: .align-right}
<img src="/images/reach+exp_sensativity-15.pdf" style="max-height: 250px; max-width: 1000px; margin-right: 16px; margin-bottom: 10px" align=left>
**Abstract:**
Dark photons ($A'$) are a theorized extension to the Standard Model (SM) which could help explain the mystery of dark matter.
Dark photons acquire small couplings to SM fermions through kinetic mixing with the SM $U(1)$ hypercharge group.
In this report, we investigate using the SciBooNE (Scintillator Booster Neutrino Experiment) and ANNIE (Accelerator Neutrino Neutron Interaction Experiment) experiments to search for dark photons.
Due to the relatively low energy of the Booster Neutrino Beam, we limit our study to dark photons produced via $\pi^0\to\gamma A'$ requiring $m_{A'}\leq m_{\pi^0}/2$.
This subsequently limits the dark photons decay modes to only $A'\to e^+e^-$ as we assume $m_{A'} < 2m_\chi$.
We present the expected sensitivity of SciBooNE to dark photons with these constraints and find that it does not probe any unexcluded parameter space.
While SciBooNE may not be useful for probing this specific model for beyond the standard model (BSM) physics, we should strive to make full use of all experiments, both current and past, to further advance physics.

### Analytical Meridional, Non-Paraxial Ray Tracing [Preprint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11SwfOfN564Hk42vlk0A2u_K2hzgacg0p/view?usp=sharing){: .btn .btn--info .btn--small}{: .align-right}
<img src="/images/exampleLens-7.pdf" style="max-height: 250px; max-width: 900px; margin-right: 16px; margin-bottom: 10px" align=left>
**Abstract:**
The study of light propagation in optical systems is crucial for various scientific and technological applications. 

The paraxial (small angle) approximation is widely used and is easily accessible both online and through introductory optics textbooks owing to it providing an elegant ray propagation method in the form of matrices. 
However, the paraxial approximation fails to accurately describe light behavior at non-small angles or with surfaces (lenses or mirrors) which are not approximately linear and perpendicular to the optical axis.
To this end, we present an analytical method for non-paraxial, meridional ray tracing through a system of basic geometric surfaces derivable from a generalized ellipse; i.e. the most general ray tracing method for a meridional (2-dimensional) system comprised of elliptical, circular, and linear surfaces. 
This work is meant as a non-small angle generalization of standard ray tracing for geometric optics.

### Isomorphisms for Real Projective Plane Constructions
<img src="/images/plots2_constructs2.pdf" style="max-height: 250px; max-width: 900px; margin-right: 16px; margin-bottom: 10px" align=left>
**Abstract:** 
The real projective plane ($\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^2$) has three well known isomorphic constructions:
the extended Euclidean plane,
unit (hemi)sphere $S^2$,
and $\mathbb{R}^3$ vector space.
Isomorphisms that map between these descriptions of $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^2$ are not commonly known.
Thus, we find isomorphisms that map between these three constructions.
Additionally, we propose several interesting uses of these constructions and their isomorphisms in classical physics and optical detectors commonly used in particle physics.
