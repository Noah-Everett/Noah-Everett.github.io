# About This Page

This page is meant to share ideas that I have had or have come across that I find interesting very interesting but am not currently working on.
I do this in the hope that someone else may find them interesting and want to work on them.
If you are interested in any of these ideas, please feel free to work on them and/or reach out to me to discuss them further!
As with most things, there is almost assuredly something that I have missed or not thought of that could make these ideas even better or worse!
I would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions on any of these ideas!

# $N$-Body Noncollision Singularities For Particle Physics

<p>
In mathematics, the $n$-body problem is the problem of predicting the individual motions of a group of particles under the influence of Newtonian grivity.
In Newtonian gravity, the gravitational force between two bodies scales as $F_g \propto 1/r^2$ where $r$ is the distance between the two bodies.
Thus, in the $n$-body problem, it is possible to have singularities where the distance between two bodies goes to zero ($r \to 0$) and the force between them goes to infinity ($F_g \to \infty$).
These are called collision singularities.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was conjectured by Poincar√© that the $n$-body problem can have noncollision singularities when $n \geq 4$ (that is when there are at least 4 bodies in the system).
This conjecture was (partially) proven in 1988 by Jeff Xia [[Xia, 1992](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2946572?origin=crossref)].
Xia found a scinario with $n=5$ where the bodies do not collide but one of the bodies goes to infinity in finite time.
Later Xue found a case for $n=4$ [[Xue, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0048)].
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin: 0;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to explore the implications of these noncollision singularities in the context of particle physics.
If possible, one can imagine particle accelerators which can exploit these singularities to outperform current particle accelerator technology.
Another potential application would be to probe the gravitational force at very small distances.
We can also trade gravity for another force which is stronger at small distances like electromagnetism.
This idea has some *serious* limitations to work around.
