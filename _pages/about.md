# About Me

Hello!

I'm Noah Everett, an undergraduate student and researcher at South Dakota Mines.
I'm majoring in physics and mathematics with minors in computer science and computational statistics.
Throughout my academic journey, I have conducted research in experimental and theoretical particle physics and optical physics, and pure mathematics, and machine learning at South Dakota Mines, SLAC National Laboratory, and Fermi National Laboratory (Fermilab).
I have been fortunate to work with truly amazing people and either directly or indirectly with experiments such as ANNIE, LZ, nEXO, SciBooNE, and SuperCDMS.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I find great fulfillment in fostering a thriving community on campus. 
I founded the Health and Fitness Club to creating a supportive environment for students interested in weightlifting, running, biking, nutrition, mental health, and overall well-being. 
Together, we share knowledge, support one another, and stay motivated on our personal health journeys through regular group activities and informative presentations.
In addition to my role in the Health and Fitness Club, I'm honored to serve as an assistant councilor for the Society of Physics Students (SPS) in zone 11, representing states including Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa, and Nebraska. 
Engaging with the SPS community has been a rewarding experience, allowing me to contribute to physics education and outreach initiatives.

Beyond academics and leadership, I find artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), deeply fascinating. 
I do my best to keep up-to-date with the latest developments and breakthroughs in the field.
I also listen to academic/science podcasts which have become regular companions on my learning journey.

This website is a platform where I'm excited to share my passions and experiences. 
It offers a glimpse into the diverse aspects of my life, whether discussing my research endeavors or sharing health/fitness insights.
I'm looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and fostering meaningful conversations.
I would love to hear from you, so please feel free to reach out!
