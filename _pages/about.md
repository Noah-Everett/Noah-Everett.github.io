Hello!

I'm Noah Everett, an undergraduate student and researcher at South Dakota Mines.
I'm majoring in physics and mathematics with minors in computer science and computational statistics.
Throughout my academic journey, I've been fortunate to conduct research in experimental and theoretical particle physics, optical physics, and pure mathematics. 
I've had the privilege of contributing to projects at South Dakota Mines, SLAC National Laboratory, and Fermi National Laboratory (Fermilab).

Beyond my academic pursuits, I find great fulfillment in fostering a thriving community on campus. 
As the founder of the Health and Fitness Club, I'm dedicated to creating a supportive environment for students interested in weightlifting, running, biking, nutrition, mental health, and overall well-being. 
Together, we share knowledge, support one another, and stay motivated on our personal health journeys through regular group activities and informative presentations.
In addition to my role in the Health and Fitness Club, I'm honored to serve as an assistant councilor for the Society of Physics Students (SPS) in zone 11, representing states including Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa, and Nebraska. 
Engaging with the SPS community has been a rewarding experience, allowing me to contribute to physics education and outreach initiatives.

Beyond academics and leadership, I find AI, particularly generative AI and Language Model Models (LLMs), deeply fascinating. 
Though I haven't personally worked on AI projects, I avidly keep up-to-date with the latest developments and breakthroughs in the field.
I also listen to academic podcasts, such as the Lex Fridman show and the Andrew Huberman Podcasts, have become regular companions on my learning journey.

This website is a platform where I'm excited to share my passions and experiences. 
It offers a glimpse into the diverse aspects of my life, whether discussing my research endeavors or sharing insights from the Andrew Huberman podcast. 
I'm looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and fostering meaningful conversations.
