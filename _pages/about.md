Hello! 
I'm an undergradute student at South Dakota Mines studying physics and mathematics with minors in computer science and computational statistics.
At school I love to keep myself (very) busy with classes, clubs, and research.
Spesifically, I'm the founder of the Health and Fitness Club and assistant zone 11 (MN, SD, ND, IA, and NE) councilor for the Society of Physics Students (SPS).
I have also conducted resaerch in the fields of experimental and theoretical particle physics, optical physics, and pure mathematics.
