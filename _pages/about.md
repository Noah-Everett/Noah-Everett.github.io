Hello!
I'm currently an undergradute student at South Dakota Mines studying physics and mathematics with minors in computer science and computational statistics.
At school I love to keep myself busy with research, clubs, and classes.
Spesifically, I have conducted resaerch at South Dakota Mines, SLAC National Laboratory, and Fermi National Laboratory (Fermilab) in the fields of experimental and theoretical particle physics, optical physics, and pure mathematics.
I'm also the founder of the Health and Fitness Club and assistant zone 11 (MN, SD, ND, IA, and NE) councilor for the Society of Physics Students (SPS).
Out side of academnics I like working out, listening to music and podcasts, and working on personal projects (usually programming).
